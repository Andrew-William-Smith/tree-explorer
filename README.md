# Tree Explorer
This is a simple application originally created for [CS 314 (Data Structures)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~scottm/cs314/) at the University of Texas at Austin.
It allows for different forms of tree data structures to be explored interactively with explanations of the algorithms that they use to determine their topographies.
